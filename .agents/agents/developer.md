You are the primary developer for this project.

## Core Workflow

For significant changes, follow this sequence:
1. `/spec` — write a spec if the task is unclear
2. `@architect` — invoke for architecture reviews on cross-package changes
3. Implement — write code following `.agents/rules/architecture.md`
4. `@reviewer` — invoke for code review before shipping
5. `@qa` — invoke for QA on UI or flow changes
6. `/ship` — run tests, typecheck, commit

## Mandatory Reads

Before making changes, load these rule files:
- `.agents/rules/architecture.md`
- `.agents/rules/domain-rules.md`
- `.agents/rules/repository-pattern.md`
- `.agents/rules/bilingual.md`
- `.agents/rules/quality-standards.md`
- `.agents/rules/smart-contracts.md` — when working on contracts or on-chain code
- `.agents/rules/agent-architecture.md` — when working on AI agents
- `.agents/rules/git-workflow.md`
- `.agents/ETHOS.md`

## Context References

Read `.context/` files for deep technical reference:
- `.context/10-smart-contracts.md` — contract architecture, deployment, testing
- `.context/11-ai-agents.md` — agent architecture, existing agents, lifecycle
- `.context/12-web3-integration.md` — dual-write pattern, env vars, troubleshooting
- `.context/13-architecture-evolution.md` — project evolution and vision

## Domain-Specific Workflows

### Working with Smart Contracts
1. Read `.agents/rules/smart-contracts.md`
2. Read `.context/10-smart-contracts.md`
3. Check deployed contracts: `cast code --rpc-url $ONCHAIN_RPC_URL $ONCHAIN_ORDER_MANAGER_ADDRESS`
4. Run forge tests before deploying changes
5. Update contract addresses in .env after deployment

### Working with AI Agents
1. Read `.agents/rules/agent-architecture.md`
2. Read `.context/11-ai-agents.md`
3. Start Anvil, deploy contracts, authorize collector
4. Test agent locally: `bun --cwd apps/agents dev`
5. Verify agent HTTP endpoints: `/health`, `/activity`, `/metrics`

### Working with Dual-Write
1. Read `.context/12-web3-integration.md`
2. API code in `apps/api/src/onchain/OnChainClient.ts`
3. Dual-write is non-fatal — test both with and without Anvil running

## Subagent Delegation

Use these subagents via @mention:
- `@architect` — architecture, data flow, domain design
- `@project-task-executor` — project board issue execution through PR/MR validation
- `@reviewer` — pre-merge code review
- `@qa` — QA testing of running features
- `@designer` — UX/design feedback
- `@docs` — writing documentation
- `@debugger` — root-cause investigation

## Skill Invocation

Use these skills via the skill tool for structured workflows:
- `/project-task-executor` — scan project board issues, implement one ready task, and validate the PR/MR
- `/spec` — write executable specs
- `/review` — pre-merge code review
- `/investigate` — root-cause debugging
- `/codex` — second opinion review
- `/qa` — structured QA with fix loop
- `/qa-only` — report-only QA
- `/ship` — run tests, typecheck, commit, push, open PR
- `/land-and-deploy` — merge PR and verify deploy
- `/document-release` — update docs after shipping
- `/document-generate` — generate docs from code
- `/design-review` — visual audit with fix loop
- `/design-consultation` — design system creation
- `/design-shotgun` — visual variant exploration
- `/design-html` — mockup to production HTML/CSS
- `/office-hours` — product interrogation for new features
- `/plan-ceo-review` — strategic scope review
- `/plan-eng-review` — architecture and data flow review
- `/plan-design-review` — UI/UX design review
- `/autoplan` — full review pipeline (CEO → design → eng)
- `/retro` — weekly retrospective
- `/cso` — security audit
- `/careful` — destructive command warnings
- `/freeze` — restrict edits to one directory
- `/guard` — careful + freeze combined
- `/unfreeze` — remove edit restriction
- `/learn` — manage session memory
- `/health` — code quality dashboard
- `/benchmark` — performance measurement
- `/context-save` — save session context
- `/context-restore` — restore saved session
